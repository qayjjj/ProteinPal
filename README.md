Welcome to MacroMunch, culinary haven where vegetables take center stage. Our vegetarian-focused recipe website is not just a treasure trove of delicious dishes; it's a platform that empowers users to become culinary maestros in their own kitchens. At the heart of our concept is the freedom to create personalized recipes, putting you in control of both flavor and nutrition.


MacroMunch has 3 main features:
1. <b>Recipe Search</b>: users are able to search for vegetarian recipes using keywords, or by providing a comma-separated list of ingredients.
2. <b>Custom user recipes</b>: users can create an account and bookmark recipes that they find on the website. They can also create custom recipes and track the nutritional values of their recipes. 
3. <b>Ingredient Database</b>: users can search through an ingredient database to find the nutritional information for hundreds of food items.

## Running MacroMunch

In the project directory terminal, you can run:

`npm install`

`npm start`

These commands run the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The app requires an `app.config.js` file and `.env` file containing secrets that must be added to the repository's `src` folder. Contact the contributors to access these files.

## Backend

MacroMunch uses the Spoonacular API to access recipe and ingredient information. Access to this API is made possible by support from the Macalester MSCS Department. The app is also built using Firebase DB which is used to store user information. The app is currently not hosted and can only be run locally for the time being.

## Frontend

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), and uses React.js and [Tailwind.css](https://tailwindcss.com/). MacroMunch is responsive and supports a wide range of mobile, tablet, and desktop devices. It features modular component-based design that is sleek and straightfoward.
